"""If an action accepts a cursor, it must hand one back.

Seven resources took a `cursor` parameter and returned `response.results` -- the
bare page, with the pagination envelope discarded. A caller could pass a cursor
but had no way to ever learn a valid value, and a truncated first page was
indistinguishable from a complete one.

This is written as a surface-wide invariant rather than seven per-module tests,
so a resource added later is covered without anyone remembering to.
