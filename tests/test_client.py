"""Which workspace a connection is bound to, and that every surface agrees on it.

A caller on a hosted client has no other way to learn the binding: the slug is
resolved from credentials it never sees. `current_workspace` reports it, and the
guarantee worth testing is that it reports the slug the tools actually act on --
a report that could disagree with them would be worse than none.
