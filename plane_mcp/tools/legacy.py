"""Keep every pre-consolidation tool name callable without advertising it.

Before consolidation this server exposed one tool per API operation. Those names
still resolve: `list_tools` is untouched, so the catalogue stays at 28, and
`get_tool` maps a retired name to its resource tool with the action pre-bound and
hidden. A script or saved prompt calling `create_label` keeps working, and costs
nothing in the listing because it is never advertised.

A retired name also keeps the parameter *spelling* it shipped with. This surface
renamed `work_item_*` parameters to `workitem_*`, and a caller reaching a tool by
its old name has no reason to have followed that: resolving the name but
rejecting `work_item_id` would be a rename dressed up as compatibility.

Each resolution is logged, so when removing these is scheduled, "nobody still
calls them" is an observation rather than an assumption.
