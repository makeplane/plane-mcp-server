"""The advertised catalogue: which resources exist, and in what order.

Previously this scanned the package with `pkgutil` and kept anything whose
filename did not start with an underscore. That made a helper's *filename*
load-bearing -- name one without the prefix and it was treated as a resource,
failing at startup with a bare `AttributeError` from `mod.register` -- and left
the ordering, which the comment below calls load-bearing, as an unpinned
side effect of `sorted()` over filenames.

Listing them explicitly costs one line per resource and buys a catalogue that is
reviewable in a diff, stable under file renames, and inert in the presence of a
stray module.
