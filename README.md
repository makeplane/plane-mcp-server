# Plane MCP Server

The Plane MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with Plane APIs, enabling projects, work items, and automations capabilities for develops and AI interfaces.

## Use Cases

- Create, update Projects and Work items
- Assign People, Properties, and Write Comments to progress on the Work
- Move and observe with various Work items in States
- Add Labels to the Work items
- Extracting and analyzing data from Projects and Members inside Plane
- Building AI powered tools and applications that interact with Plane's ecosystem

## Configuration Parameters
