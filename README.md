# Plane MCP Server

The Plane MCP Server brings the power of Model Context Protocol (MCP) to Plane, allowing AI agents and developer tools to interact programmatically with your Plane workspace.

Whether you're building intelligent assistants, automation scripts, or workflow-driven tools, this server provides a seamless bridge to Plane’s API—so you can create projects, manage issues, assign tasks, and keep your work in sync with AI-powered tools.

## What can you do with it?
This server unlocks all sorts of useful capabilities for anyone working with Plane:

- Spin up projects and work items directly from your AI or app interface.

- Update progress, assign team members, set properties, or add comments—all programmatically.

- Move issues through workflows and update their states on the fly.

- Organize work with labels, modules, and cycles.

- Analyze data about your team’s work across projects.

- Build smart apps that interact naturally with Plane—whether it’s an AI agent logging work, or a bot keeping projects tidy.

      ],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "PLANE_API_HOST_URL": "<HOST_URL_FOR_SELF_HOSTED>",
        "PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG": "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_SLUG>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VSCode

You can also connect Plane to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server) by editing your `.vscode.json` or `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@makeplane/plane-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "PLANE_API_HOST_URL": "<HOST_URL_FOR_SELF_HOSTED>",
